### Investigating Search Engines and Directories
- _Search Site_: Website where you can search for information
- _Search Engine_: System that
    - collects pages
    - saves them in a massive database
    - indexes the information
    - provides a way for people to search through the information
- _Search Index_: Index containing information that the engine collected
- _Search Directory_: System that contains
    - basic information about websites
    - NOT collected and indexed web pages

### Search Index
- Large search-index companies
    - own thousands of computers
    - use software known as
        - spiders
        - searchbots
        - robots
        - (or just plain bots)
    - to grab web pages
    - and read the information in them
- Use complex algorithms - calculations based on complicated formulae
- To index that information
- and rank it in search results when people search

### Search Directories
- Before search engines
- A categorized collection of information about websites
- Not information about individual web pages
- Way before Google, Yahoo! was America's dominant search site
- Not created using spiders or bots
- Contains information such as
    - the title
    - description
    - category
- submitted by the site owner
- Have staff members to examine the sites in the directory
- Small directories accept sites as is submitted by the owner
- Recent significant search directories
    - Yahoo!
    - Open Directory Project (formerly known as Directory Mozilla - DMOZ)
- Not as important as Search Engines anymore

### Spidered Directories
- A form of directory, but generated programmatically
- Some directories use spiders to grab a little background information
    - titles
    - descriptions
    - keywords
- In some cases this information is filled by the person who enters the site into the index

### Pay-per-click (PPC) systems
- Many search sites provide PPC listings
- Advertisers place ads into the PPC
- Results contains these sponsored listings
- Above or to the right of the free listings

### Search Site
- Website that provides search results
- Website that lets to search through some kind of index or directory or both
- Examples
    - Google.com
    - AOL.com
    - EarthLink.com
- Some search sites allow to search through multiple indices - meta indexes
- Examples
    - Dogpile.com
    - Mamma.com

### Search System
- Organization which possess
    - Software
    - Hardware
    - People
- Indexes or categorizes websites
- Builds the index or directory that's used by a search site
- A search site may or may not own a search index or directory
- Google is a search system
    - Displays results from the index it creates
- AOL.com and EarthLink.com are not search systems
    - They use Google's search index

### Other Terms
- _Search Term_: word or words that is typed into the search engine
- _Search Results_: Results returned by the search term
- _SERP_: Search Engine Results Page - the page on which the search results are displayed
- _Natural Search Results_: (unpaid) results that are displayed because the search engine thinks the result matches the search term (`organic` or `algorithmic` search results)

### Why bother with search engines?
- Single most important source of _new_ visitors
- 80% of visitors reach through a search engine
- Most searches are carried out on a very small number of search sites
    - How to measure popularity of search sites
        - Percentage of visitors (audience reach)
        - Total number of visitors
        - Total number of searches carried out
        - Total number of hours visitors spend searching
- Whether or not the results are included from local index, shopping index, PPC index depends on the type of search made

### The Big Tow: Organic and PPC
- Organic-results index is created by searchbots
- Google uses googlebot to retrieve pages
- Searchbots wander around the web
    - moving from page to page
    - collecting the pages
    - reading them
- Bots are programs that send requests to web servers asking for pages just like a web browser does
- Most search results include PPC ads
- Ads does not cost the advertiser anything until a user clicks the ad
- 2 categories of PPC ads
    - Simple text ads
    - `Shopping` or `product listing` ads which contain images

### Local Results
- Incredibly important
- Huge presence in many search results pages
- Often appear above organic search results
- Below PPC ads
- Important consideration for businesses that serve a particular geographic area

### Shopping Results
- Product indexes are separate from organic or reqular text-based PPC indexes
- But it is typically a form of PPC advertising
- Submit your products to the search engines' product listings and get charged if someone clicks the search result
- If the search engine feels the user is searching for a product, it inserts matching product listings into the SERP

### Staying current with News Results
- Another significant search result component
- If the search engine feels the user might benefit from a news result, it inserts the news result into the SERP

### Viewing Video and Image Results
- All major search engines index Youtube results
- They index other video hosting sites like Vimeo.com, vevo.com and Metacafe.com

### Getting friendly with Social Results
- Different search engines use this data in different ways
- Social networks are important as way to feed information into search results

### Is your site indexed?
- Important to find out if your site is in a search engine or directory
- some browser add-ons tells you the number of indexed pages when you visit a site (example: SEOQuake)

### Open Directory Project
- Large directory of websites
- Owned by AOL
- Run by volunteers
- Provides many links back to your site
- Getting your site listed can be difficult
- Type in the domain name and if the site is listed, Open Directory will tell you
- If it's not listed, you should try to list it

### Reasons your site may not be indexed
- No links pointing to the site, search engines don't know the site exists
    - Most common reason
    - No incoming links
    - Search engines crawl the web, following links from site to site
    - No links on other sites pointing to your website
- Web server is unreliable
    - Site keeps crashing
    - Unavailable when the search engines come by to crawl it
    - They can't or won't crawl (prevent listing sites with bad user experience)
- `robots.txt` is blocking search-engine access to the site
- `robots` meta tag is blocking pages individually
- You bought a garbage domain name
    - A previously blocked domain name by search engines
    - If no one has used the domain name before, it is a good domain name
    - Current domain name with links pointing to it but not indexed, means a bad sign
    - Check a snapshot of the site of the domain from previous use using archive.org
- Navigation structure that search engines can't read, so they can't find their way through the site
- Site is creating dyanmic pages that search engines choose not to read
- You have a _canonical_ tag referencing another web site

### Picking Good Keywords
- Knowing the words, people are using to search for a website, is important
- Use Google's adwords keyword tool to check how different keywords perform

### Examining Your Pages
- Title tags
    - Many pages don't have the title tags. So search engines do not get the subject of the page
    - Wrong position - too far down in the page where search engines don't find them
    - More than one title tag - search engine looks at only the first title tag they find
    - Same title tag on all the pages - every title tag should be different
    - Poor - does not contain the proper keywords
- The description tag
    - Important because search engines may index it as the description of the page or site
    - 2 purposes
        - help with ranking in search engines
        - convince people to click the search results
    - It's a meta tag
    - Often has the same problems the title tags have
- Eliminating Flash and Silverlight
    - Flash are simple animations on web pages
- Replacing images with real text
    - Text on images can't be read by search engines so it's not indexed
- Using the right keywords in the right places
    - Use keywords in folder names and file names, page files and image files
    - Use keywords near the top of the page
    - Place keywords into <H> (heading) tags
    - Use **bold** and *italic* keywords
    - Put keywords into bulleted lists
    - Use keywords multiple times on a page - also too much repetition is bad
