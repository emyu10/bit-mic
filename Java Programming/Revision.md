# An Introduction to Java
## Java Programming Tools
Most popular Java development tools are as follows
### 1. Eclipse
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- Can be used for almost all programming languages.
- Open source.
- Supports C, C++, C#, Perl, Python, etc.

### 2. Netbeans
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- Runs on all major desktop operating systems.
- Earlier used to deal with Java Swing wizard framework.

### 3. Junit
### 4. Apache Spark
### 5. Jenkins
### 6. Android Studio
### 7. Apache Maven
### 8. Gradle
### 9. JCreator

## History of Java
- Initiated by James Gosling in 1991.
- First target - programming set-top boxes.
- First name "Oak".
- On 13th November 2006, Sun made Java free and open source.
- Java promised "write once, run everywhere" (WORA), changed to the concept platform independent.
- Later released more enhanced version under GNU General Public License.

## Tools You Need
- To run a Java program, user needs Pentium 200Mhz computer with a minimum 64MB RAM (recommended is 128MB).
- You also need.
    - Linux 7.1 or later / Windows XP or later.
    - JDK (Java Development Kit).
    - Text editor.

## Advantages of Java / Java White Paper Buzzwords
### 1. Java is easy to learn / simple
1. Easy to use, easy to write, easy to compile, easy to deploy.
2. Java is very close to C++.
3. Poor features from C++ removed in Java like operator overloading, pointers, multiple inheritance.
4. Syntax similar to C/C++.

### 2. Java is object-oriented
- Enables modular programming and reuse of code.
- Easily extensible because based on objects and classes.
- Mainly focuses on data, objects and methods.
- All OOP concepts present except multiple inheritance.

### 3. Java is platform independent
- Allows to move programs from one computer to another, regardless of the operating system.
- Compiled into bytecode which runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

### 4. Java is Multi-Threaded
- Capable to perform several tasks simultaneously.
- Smoothly integrated into IDEs.
- Helps to write interactive applications.

### 5. Java is distributed
- Made easy with networking capability.
- Network programming like RMI is easy.
