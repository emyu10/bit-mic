## Characteristics of Good Software
### 1. Operational
1. **Budget**: cost effective software
2. **Usability**: usable or fit to be used software
3. **Efficiency**: ability to do things well with minimum resources.
4. **Dependability**: software must be trustworthy and reliable. Dependability is a measure of reliability, safety and security.
5. **Safety**: keep data from threats. Data, software and hardware should be protected from intruders.

### 2. Transitional
1. **Portability**: should be easily carried or moved
2. **Inter-operability**: ability to run on hardware from different vendors regardless of the physical architecture.
3. **Reusability**: must be reusable for the future. Should be able to modify for future changes in the requirements.

### 3. Maintainable
1. **Modularity**:
    - The degree to which a system component can be separated and recombined.
    - Software that's dividable into smaller modules.
2. **Maintainability**:
    - A failed equipment, machine or system can be restored to its normal operable state within a given timeframe.
3. **Flexibility**: Ability to change or changed according to the situation.
## Characteristics of the Software as a Process
## Characteristics of the Software as a Product
## The Need for the Software Engineering Discipline
- It arises because of higher rate of change in
    - user requirements and
    - environments on which software is working

1. Large Software
    - Programmers have to study the software carefully.
2. Scalability
    - If SE is not properly done, programmers cannot scale the existing software.
3. Cost
    - Costs can increase if proper process is not adapted.
4. Dynamic Nature
    - Due to the rapid changing nature of software, programmers have to seek new methodologies.
5. Quality Management
    - To ensure quality of software.

# Software Development
## Software Engineering Goals
## Importance of a phased approach to software development
### Phases or Stages of Software Development Process
#### 1. Planning
- First phase in software development.
- Checks whether there is the need for a new system.
- To find problems and determine solutions.

#### 2. System Analysis
- Analyse the performance of a software by supplying various inputs.
- Checks whether all solutions fits the requirements.
- Requirement gathering.

#### 3. System Design
- Clients (end-users) determine their information needs.
- Programmers create basic architecture.

#### 4. Development
- Coding (real programming starts here).
- Using a high level programming language.
    - Low level language
        - Only 1s and 0s.
        - Another name is machine language.
    - Assembly language
        - English-like keywords are used
        - Example: add, sub, mul, div ... etc
    - High level language
        - Modern programming languages like C, C++, VB, Java

#### 5. Integration and Testing
- Merging all modules as a whole system.
- Check all modules and integrate into one system.

#### 6. Implementation
- Installation of newly created system.
- Old system is replaced by new system.

#### 7. Maintenance
- Upgrade the system from time to time.
- To adapt changes.

### System Analyst
- Main person who is responsible for development of software / hardware.

#### Roles of System Analyst
1. Defining IT requirements
2. Gathering data
3. Analyze problem
4. Setting priority to the jobs
5. Problem solving
6. Design system
7. Evaluating system

## Phases involved in software development process
## Compare how software development companies organize their development process
# Software Development Process Model
# Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- It is a *well defined*, *structured* sequence of *stages* in software engineering.

## Stages (Phases) of SDLC
### 1. Communication
- First step in SDLC.
- Initiate the request for software product.
- Try to negotiate the terms.
- Client gives all information to developers in writing.

### 2. Requirement Gathering
- Development team manages this stage.
- Developers collect more data from the client.
- Study the existing system with
    1. Questionnaires
    2. Interviews
- Developers collect answers from the questionnaires.

### 3. Feasibility Study
- Developers start designing a software in a cost-effective way.
- There are 4 types of feasibility study
    1. Technical feasibility
    2. Operational feasibility
    3. Economic feasibility
    4. Schedule feasibility

### 4. Detailed System Study
- Various operations are performed by the system and their relationship within and outside the system is studied.
- All the data is documented in
    1. Detailed Data Flow Diagrams
    2. Data Dictionary
    3. Logical Data Structures

### 5. System Design
- New system starts.
- Features of new system is designed.
- Cost of development is estimated.
- System Analyst selects best solution from all feasible solutions.

### 6. Coding
### 7. Testing
### 8. Implementation
### 9. Maintenance
