### Assessment Details
> Case Study 20%

After first four topics, a case study based on the topic will be given. Each case study will contain a range of questions covering the topic. The students are expected to analyse the case and answer it.

Quizzes will be administered according to the following table.

| CASE STUDY | TOPICS COVERED |
| --- | --- |
| Case Study 1 | From Topic 1 to Topic 4 |
| Case Study 2 | From Topic 5 to Topic 8 |

> Written Assignment 30%

The students will be provided an assignment worksheet of sixteen questions. The assignment must be submitted within seven working days after the last lecture. The assignment task will be given before the last week of lecture sessions.

> Final Examination 50%

Final examination paper will be assessed out of 100 marks.<br>
The paper will be set for 3 hours plus 10 minutes reading time.<br>
The examination paper will consist of three sections.
- Section A: 10 multiple-choice questions carrying 1 mark each
- Section B: 10 short answer questions carrying 4 marks each
- Section C: 5 structured questions carrying 10 marks each
